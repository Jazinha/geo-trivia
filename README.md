# Geo-trivia 

## Description   

  This is a 5 question timed trivia quiz on geography. The user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz and everytime a question is answered incorrectly the time lessens by 10 seconds, which gives the user less time to complete the quiz. If the user runs out of time it will be automatically be GAMEOVER. 
  Every time they choose an answer for a question, "Correct!" or "Wrong!" will display below the submit button, depending on their answer, so the user is aware of which questions they got right and wrong.  
  If the user completes the quiz they will be taken to the GAMEOVER page, where their final score will display as well as a place to enter their initials. They will then have the chance to retake the quiz, by clicking on the "homepage" link. 

## User Story
